## Introduction
This project leverages the power of the `mediapipe` library for facial recognition and tracking, `opencv` for image processing, and `PyAutoGUI` for controlling the mouse. It offers a novel way of interacting with your computer by using facial gestures.

## Features
- Track facial landmarks in real-time.
- Control mouse movement with facial gestures.
- Click using specific facial expressions (e.g., blinking).
